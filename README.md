# Decathlon-Tableau-GenZ_Campaign
During my first Semester in Masterâ€™s in Big Data Analytics for Business, I had the opportunity to work on a very inspiring project with Adeyinka Adegbenro and Kene Mbamali, 
where we analyzed the impact of an influencer marketing campaign launched by Decathlon France in collaboration with the fitness influencer Sissy Mua.

In September 2020, Decathlon's Domyos brand ran a limited-edition fitness apparel campaign promoted through an Instagram event. 
With a 30Kâ‚¬ budget, the campaign aimed to engage Gen Z consumers and drive purchases through social media. 
Our goal? Evaluate whether the campaign successfully attracted new loyal customers and assess its profitability.
